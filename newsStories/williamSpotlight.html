        <p class="text-justify newsText">William Bennett has always been an avid Nintendo fan. Armed with a Wii, he
          would spend his youth playing various Wii games throughout the day. However, in 2008, a game was released that
          would eventually transform Bennett’s entire life. That game, published by Nintendo, was the famous and
          award-winning Super Smash Bros. Brawl. Designed as a crossover fighting game between various Nintendo
          characters, the game was perfect for Bennett as it connected the worlds of many of the characters he grew to
          love in his childhood.

        <p class="text-justify newsText">Bennett tried Smash for the first time in early 2016 with Super Smash Bros.
          Brawl. He would frequently go to friends’ houses and play for hours. Even though he began by playing with his
          friends casually, since then, Smash has become a pivotal part of Bennet’s life.
          What brought him into the competitive scene, however, was a year later when Bennett started playing Super
          Smash Bros. Melee online using an emulator. While playing online, he learned of his local competitive scene
          and started attending a “local,” which are local competitions held for any nearby players (LANs). In his first
          local, he finished 0-2, but this didn’t discourage him. He became a regular at Player One Esports’ locals,
          which frequented 25-35 competitors, and after years of practice, he earned 1st place!

        <p class="text-justify newsText">The social aspect of the game has also been a significant motivator for
          Bennett. At his locals, “everybody there was super nice,” Bennett recalled. “Being able to have those kinds of
          people and positive social interactions is what really motivated me to keep learning and growing as a player.”
          Ever since then, he’s been hooked. Playing Smash games has not only improved his social skills and made him
          numerous connections, but also boosted his confidence and attitude towards challenges. “Before Smash, I never
          really had much of a chance … to see that much self improvement,” Bennett said. “By being able to overcome and
          break down those walls … is definitely a huge part of Smash for me.” The relentless effort required to better
          himself as a player changed his mindset towards working hard to achieve his goals. Before he even joined
          Carmel Esports, Smash was a pivotal part of his life. In the first semester of his freshman year, he tried out
          for the team and made it as a starter.

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-12">
        <p class="text-justify newsText">Since then, Bennett has become an increasingly essential part of the Carmel
          Esports’ community. He’s been a captain for the Super Smash Bros. Ultimate (SSBU) team with another player
          since the Fall of 2019. This Spring, however, Bennett was a solo captain for the SSBU team. Through his
          leadership, the SSBU roster earned 1st in IHSEN and 3rd and 4th place standings in the Eastern Region of
          PlayVS. He’s also recently joined the club’s socials team and is already making great strides for its
          community! He aspires to become an official graphic designer for the team in order to make attractive visuals
          for social media posts.

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-12">
        <p class="text-justify newsText">Beyond graduation, Bennett dreams of playing Smash at the collegiate level. The
          dream is to “at least acquire [an esports scholarship] for Smash, which should make college a lot easier.” If
          not, he still claims that “I definitely would like Smash to become a lifelong thing." Even though he’s already
          so well established within the team, he’s only halfway through his high school career. With multiple winnings
          under his belt and two years left in high school, Bennett has nowhere to go but up.
